# library

Creating a online library from scratch only with basic guidance.  
Includes adding and removing books as well as marking them as read or not read.

Currently only works flawlessly with Google Chrome!  
(the changing of the read-state does not work otherwise, I may or may not come back lateron, when im more proficient in JavaScript, to fix this bug)
  
Working version can be found [HERE](https://faaabi93.github.io/library/).
